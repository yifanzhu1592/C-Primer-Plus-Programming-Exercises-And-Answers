/* Prgramming Exercise 5-2 */

// Write a program that asks for an integer and then prints all the integers from (and
// including) that value up to (and including) a value larger by 10. (That is, if the input is 5,
// the output runs from 5 to 15.) Be sure to seperate each output value by a space or tab or
// newline.


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int n, m;
	
	printf("Please enter an integer:\n");
	scanf("%d", &n);
	m = n + 10;
	while (n <= m)
	{
		printf("%d\n", n);
		n++;
	}
	
	return 0;
}
